This repository is created for a university project for tracking drones.


The project was created in two parts the first part deals with the frontend , while the second part deals with the backend ( business logic )
The part of the frontend has been developed through the framework spring boot and angularjs . Through spring boot I built an embedded application .
The second part has been realized using Java EE . The backend application is being deployed with weblogic .
